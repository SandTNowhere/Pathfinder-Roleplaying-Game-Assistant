#File for the class class


# Class class (looking for better name than CLS)

class CLS:
    name = 'herp-derp'
    level = 1
    stats = 0 # condensed BAB, and saves into this for brevity, can be changed up later
    skills = ['null']
    ranks = 0
	# features go here how their done is TBD
	text = 'null' # for any overarching text with little to no value mechanically
	
	Archetype = 'null' # this should be for later and switch out class features for others
