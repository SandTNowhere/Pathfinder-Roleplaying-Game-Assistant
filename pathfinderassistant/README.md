Basic Django example to work off of

Nick and I came up with this today. It is a basic Django project that allows you to create a (very) basic character sheet, view it, and edit it.

Our code is based off the Django tutorial here: http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/

Make sure you are using python >=3.4 and django >=1.8
Once those two are installed correctly running 'python manage.py runserver' in the project directory should start the website up with no issues.
