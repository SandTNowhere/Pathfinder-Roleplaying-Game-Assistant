1,Unarmed strike,simple weapon,light,0,3,1,diminutive,20,2,-1,0,B,"""An unarmed strike is an attack such as a punch or a kick where the attacker is not using a weapon to make the attack. A Medium character deals 1d3 points of nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike. A Small character deals 1d2 points of nonlethal damage. A monk or any character with the Improved Unarmed Strike feat can deal lethal or nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes at his discretion. The damage from an unarmed strike is considered weapon damage for the purposes of effects that give you a bonus on weapon damage rolls. An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon. Therefore, you can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with an unarmed strike. Unarmed strikes do not count as natural weapons (Core Rulebook 182). An unarmed strike can't be disarmed."""
2,Battle aspergillum,simple weapon,light,5,6,1,diminutive,20,2,-1,4,B,"""Named for the common aspergillum, a macelike tool used by priests to sprinkle holy water, this light mace has a hollow head and a metal plug closing off the hole through which the head is filled. When the mace strikes a creature, holy water sprinkles out through tiny holes throughout the weapon's head; creatures subject to damage from holy water take 1 point of damage in addition to the normal effect of being struck by the mace (a nonmagical aspergillum can deal holy water damage to an incorporeal creature in this manner, even if the mace itself deals no damage). After 5 hits, the battle aspergillum is empty and needs to be refilled. Filling it with holy water is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity (like drinking a potion). A filled aspergillum is normally carried upright, to prevent the holy water from leaking out as the weapon moves."""
3,Brass knuckles,simple weapon,light,1,3,1,diminutive,20,2,-1,1,B,"""These weapons fit snugly around the knuckles and allow you to deal lethal damage with an unarmed strike.

Monks are proficient with brass knuckles. Brass knuckles can't be disarmed."""
4,Cestus,simple weapon,light,5,4,1,diminutive,19,2,-1,1,B or P,"""The cestus is a glove of leather or thick cloth that covers the wielder from mid-finger to mid-forearm. The close combat weapon is reinforced with metal plates over the fingers and often lined with wicked spikes along the backs of the hands and wrists. While wearing a cestus, you are considered armed and your unarmed attacks deal lethal damage. If you are proficient with a cestus, you can have your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning or piercing damage. Monks are proficient with the cestus. When using a cestus, your fingers are mostly exposed, allowing you to wield or carry items in that hand, but the constriction of the weapon at your knuckles gives you a –2 penalty on all precision-based tasks involving that hand (such as opening locks). A cestus can't be disarmed."""
5,Dagger,simple weapon,light,2,4,1,diminutive,19,2,10,1,P or S,"""A dagger is a fighting knife. Its blade is usually less than 1 foot long, and can be curved or straight, with one edge or two.

Loading a heavy crossbow is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A heavy crossbow fires crossbow bolts. Normally, operating a heavy crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a heavy crossbow with one hand at a –4 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a heavy crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two one-handed weapons. This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing."""
25,Javelin,simple weapon,two,1,6,1,medium,20,2,30,2,P,"""A javelin is a thin throwing spear . Since it is not designed for melee, you are treated as nonproficient with it and take a –4 penalty on attack rolls if you use a javelin as a melee weapon."""

Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a sling, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand. Loading a sling is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity. A sling fires sling bullets.

A harpoon's weight includes 10 pounds for the weight of 50 feet of hemp rope. The weight can be reduced by using shorter or lighter rope. If you are not proficient with a harpoon, treat it like a spear."""
151,Kusarigama,exotic weapon,two,12,6,1,medium,20,2,-1,3,S or B,"""This weapon has a single kama or sickle held in the off hand, attached by 10 feet of fine chain to a weighted metal ball. The sickle can be used to make trip attacks, jabs, and blocks, while the ball is whipped around at high speeds and then smashed into the opponent, or used to tangle an opponent's sword or spear, allowing the wielder to then attack with the sickle."""
152,Kyoketsu shoge,exotic weapon,two,6,4,1,medium,20,2,20,1,S or P,"""This weapon consists of a foot-long double-edged blade, with another smaller, curved hook-blade sticking out the side like a rooster's spur. The blade is strung to a large iron hoop with a 10-foot length of rope. The blade can be used as an off-handed melee weapon or thrown like a dagger, while the rope and circlet can be whipped around and swung at opponents as a bludgeoning reach weapon."""
153,Mancatcher,exotic weapon,two,15,2,1,medium,20,0,-1,10,P,"""This polearm consists of two curved metal bands that close around a target when you attack, allowing you to bind an opponent. A mancatcher is built to capture a creature of a particular size category (such as Small or Medium) and doesn't work on creatures of the wrong size. Make a touch attack to hit an opponent and a combat maneuver check to grapple him (without the –4 penalty for not having two hands free); success means you and the target are grappled. Once the target is grappled, you can perform a move or damage grapple action against him. The mancatcher has hardness 10 and 5 hit points; breaking it requires a DC 26 Strength check. If you drop the mancatcher, the target can free himself as a standard action."""
154,Meteor hammer,exotic weapon,two,10,8,1,medium,20,2,-1,10,B,"""This weapon consists of one or two spherical weights attached by a 10-foot chain. You whirl the weights and wrap them around an opponent's body. If you succeed at a trip attempt with a meteor hammer, you can drag your opponent 5 feet closer to you rather than knocking her prone. You may use this weapon in two different ways: In meteor mode you use it as a double weapon, while in fortress mode you cannot use it as a double weapon but gain reach and a +1 shield bonus to AC. Switching between these two modes is a free action decided at the start of your turn."""
155,Orc double axe,exotic weapon,two,60,8,1,medium,20,3,-1,15,S,"""A cruel weapon with blades placed at opposite ends of a long haft, an orc double axe is a double weapon. Though invented by and traditionally associated with orcs, the double axe can be crafted and wielded by other races as well, though many disdain it for its extreme weight and clumsiness. Because of the blades at either end of the axe, the wielder must hold an orc double axe in the middle of its haft, and utilize a weaving, slashing fighting style more akin to that of a quarterstaff than to that of a greataxe or battleaxe."""
156,Seven-branched sword,exotic weapon,two,50,10,1,medium,20,3,-1,7,S,"""This unusual sword has a straight 2-foot-long blade with six shorter L-shaped blades protruding from it, three on each side in a staggered pattern. The shorter blades can be used to snag opponents' clothing or armor, or can target weapons in order to disarm them. To snag armor or clothing, the attacker makes a trip attempt. If successful, the victim doesn't fall prone, but instead is snagged and stumbles forward, leaving the victim flat-footed for the remainder of the round."""
157,Spiked chain,exotic weapon,two,25,4,2,medium,20,2,-1,10,P,"""A spiked chain is about 4 feet in length and covered in wicked barbs. Some have metal hoops to use as handgrips. You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a spiked chain sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon."""
158,Tetsubo,exotic weapon,two,20,10,1,medium,20,4,-1,10,B,"""A slight improvement over the greatclub, this weapon consists of a long, slender length of wood or metal whose upper half is shod with a thick sheet of studded iron. The iron gives added weight and strength to the club, while the studs are designed to crack helmets and armor."""
159,Two-bladed sword,exotic weapon,two,100,8,1,medium,19,2,-1,10,S,"""A two-bladed sword is a double weapon—twin blades extend from either side of a central, short haft, allowing the wielder to attack with graceful but deadly flourishes."""
160,Bolas,exotic weapon,two,5,4,1,medium,20,2,10,2,B,"""A bolas is a pair of wooden, stone, or metal weights connected by a thin rope or cord. You can whirl and throw this weapon to make a ranged trip attack against an opponent. You can't be tripped during your own trip attempt when using a bolas."""
161,Boomerang,exotic weapon,two,3,6,1,medium,20,2,30,3,B,"""The boomerang is primarily a hunting tool, but it is not uncommon for these versatile thrown weapons to be carried into battle. A boomerang is made of wood and is flat, with a long haft, a pronounced forward curve, and a sharp backward bend at the head. A hunting boomerang does not fly in a returning path."""
162,Double crossbow,exotic weapon,two,300,8,1,medium,19,2,80,18,P,"""This heavy weapon fires a pair of iron-tipped bolts with a single squeeze of the trigger. Because of its size and weight, you take a –4 penalty on your attack roll if you're proficient with it, or –8 if you're not. If the attack hits, the target takes damage from both bolts. Critical hits, sneak attack damage, and other precision-based damage apply to only the first bolt. Reloading one bolt is a standard action; the Rapid Reload feat reduces this to a move action. Crossbow Mastery allows you to reload both bolts as a move action. A double crossbow fires crossbow bolts."""
163,Halfling sling staff,exotic weapon,two,20,8,1,medium,20,3,80,3,B,"""Made from a specially designed sling attached to a short club, a halfling sling staff can be used by a proficient wielder to devastating effect. Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a halfling sling staff, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a halfling sling staff with one hand. Loading a halfling sling staff is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity. A halfling sling staff fires bullets. You can hurl ordinary stones with a halfling sling staff, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you and you take a –1 penalty on attack rolls. A halfling sling staff can be used as a simple weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of its size. Halflings treat halfling sling staves as martial weapons."""
164,Hand crossbow,exotic weapon,two,100,4,1,medium,19,2,30,2,P,"""You can draw a hand crossbow back by hand. Loading a hand crossbow is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A hand crossbow fires standard crossbow bolts, like those used by light and heavy crossbows. You can shoot, but not load, a hand crossbow with one hand at no penalty. You can shoot a hand crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons."""
165,Kestros,exotic weapon,two,1,8,1,medium,20,3,50,1,P,"""The kestros is an oddly shaped Bronze Age sling used for launching kestros darts. Your Strength modifier applies on damage rolls when you use a kestros, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire—but not load—a kestros with one hand. Loading a kestros is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity. Halflings treat the kestros as a martial weapon."""
166,Lasso,exotic weapon,two,1,0,0,medium,20,0,-1,5,,"""This thrown weapon is a length of rope with a simple open knot on one end that allows you entangle a foe like you would using a net. The DC to cast a spell while entangled with a lasso is 10 + the spell level being cast. An entangled creature can slip free with a successful DC 15 Escape Artist check as a full-round action. The lasso has 2 hit points and AC 10, and requires a DC 23 Strength check to break it. On a successful hit, the lasso tightens; to use it again you must spend a standard action sliding the knot to enlarge the loop."""
167,Net,exotic weapon,two,20,0,0,medium,20,0,10,6,,"""A net is used to entangle enemies. When you throw a net, you make a ranged touch attack against your target. A net's maximum range is 10 feet. If you hit, the target is entangled. An entangled creature takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty to Dexterity, can move at only half speed, and cannot charge or run. If you control the trailing rope by succeeding at an opposed Strength check while holding it, the entangled creature can move only within the limits that the rope allows. If the entangled creature attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed at a concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell's level or be unable to cast the spell. An entangled creature can escape with a successful DC 20 Escape Artist check (a full-round action). The net has 5 hit points and can be burst with a successful DC 25 Strength check (also a full-round action). A net is useful only against creatures within one size category of you. A net must be folded to be thrown effectively. The first time you throw your net in a fight, you make a normal ranged touch attack roll. After the net is unfolded, you take a –4 penalty on attack rolls with it. It takes 2 rounds for a proficient user to fold a net and twice that long for a nonproficient one to do so."""
168,Repeating hand crossbow,exotic weapon,two,800,4,1,medium,19,2,30,4,P,"""The repeating heavy crossbow holds 5 repeating crossbow bolts. As long as it holds bolts, you can reload it by pulling the reloading lever (a free action). Loading a new case of 5 bolts is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. You can fire a repeating crossbow with one hand or fire a repeating crossbow in each hand in the same manner as you would a normal crossbow of the same size. However, you must fire the weapon with two hands in order to use the reloading lever, and you must use two hands to load a new case of bolts."""
169,Repeating heavy crossbow,exotic weapon,two,400,10,1,medium,19,2,120,12,P,"""The repeating heavy crossbow holds 5 repeating crossbow bolts. As long as it holds bolts, you can reload it by pulling the reloading lever (a free action). Loading a new case of 5 bolts is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. You can fire a repeating crossbow with one hand or fire a repeating crossbow in each hand in the same manner as you would a normal crossbow of the same size. However, you must fire the weapon with two hands in order to use the reloading lever, and you must use two hands to load a new case of bolts."""
170,Repeating light crossbow,exotic weapon,two,250,8,1,medium,19,2,80,6,P,"""This weapon functions identically to a repeating heavy crossbow, except its damage, critical, and range values are equivalent to those of a hand crossbow instead."""
171,Rope dart,exotic weapon,two,1,4,1,medium,20,2,20,0,P,"""This deceptively complex weapon appears to be nothing more than a 12-foot rope attached to a 6-inch-long, conical metal spike. Similar to a meteor hammer, it can be whirled at great speeds, then aimed to strike and pierce opponents with great reach. Once it strikes, the wielder can quickly retrieve the weapon with a tug of the rope as a free action."""
172,Shuriken 5,exotic weapon,two,1,2,1,medium,20,2,10,0.5,P,"""A shuriken is a small piece of metal with sharpened edges, designed for throwing. A shuriken can't be used as a melee weapon. Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them and crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them, and of what happens to them after they are thrown."""
173,Snag net,exotic weapon,two,30,0,0,medium,20,0,10,10,P,"""This short, wide net is covered in barbed loops and slipknots. It works like a typical net, except it has the trip weapon special feature. If you entangle an opponent and hold the trailing rope, on your turn in place of a melee attack you may make a combat maneuver check to trip against that opponent; if you succeed, you may trip your opponent or deal 1 point of piercing damage to it. The concentration DC to cast while entangled in a snag net is 17 + the spell's level. The Escape Artist DC to escape a snag net is 22."""
174,Throwing shield,exotic weapon,two,50,6,1,medium,20,2,20,0,B,"""This shield is designed for throwing and has specially designed straps that allow you to unclasp and throw it as a free action. Tower shields cannot be throwing shields. Neither a shield's enhancement bonus to AC nor its shield spikes apply on your attack or damage rolls. A throwing shield can't be disarmed."""
