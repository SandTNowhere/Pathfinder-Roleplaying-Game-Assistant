1,Unarmed strike,simple weapon,light,0,3,1,diminutive,20,2,-1,0,B,"""An unarmed strike is an attack such as a punch or a kick where the attacker is not using a weapon to make the attack. A Medium character deals 1d3 points of nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike. A Small character deals 1d2 points of nonlethal damage. A monk or any character with the Improved Unarmed Strike feat can deal lethal or nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes at his discretion. The damage from an unarmed strike is considered weapon damage for the purposes of effects that give you a bonus on weapon damage rolls.
An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon. Therefore, you can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with an unarmed strike. Unarmed strikes do not count as natural weapons (Core Rulebook 182). An unarmed strike can't be disarmed."""
2,Battle aspergillum,simple weapon,light,5,6,1,diminutive,20,2,-1,4 ,B,"""Named for the common aspergillum, a macelike tool used by priests to sprinkle holy water, this light mace has a hollow head and a metal plug closing off the hole through which the head is filled. When the mace strikes a creature, holy water sprinkles out through tiny holes throughout the weapon's head; creatures subject to damage from holy water take 1 point of damage in addition to the normal effect of being struck by the mace (a nonmagical aspergillum can deal holy water damage to an incorporeal creature in this manner, even if the mace itself deals no damage). After 5 hits, the battle aspergillum is empty and needs to be refilled. Filling it with holy water is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity (like drinking a potion). A filled aspergillum is normally carried upright, to prevent the holy water from leaking out as the weapon moves."""
3,Brass knuckles,simple weapon,light,1,3,1,diminutive,20,2,-1,1,B,"""These weapons fit snugly around the knuckles and allow you to deal lethal damage with an unarmed strike. You may hold, but not wield, a weapon or other object in a hand wearing brass knuckles. You may cast a spell with a somatic component while wearing brass knuckles if you make a successful concentration check (DC 10 + the level of the spell you're casting). Monks are proficient with brass knuckles. Brass knuckles can't be disarmed."""
4,Cestus,simple weapon,light,5,4,1,diminutive,19,2,-1,1,B or P,"""The cestus is a glove of leather or thick cloth that covers the wielder from mid-finger to mid-forearm. The close combat weapon is reinforced with metal plates over the fingers and often lined with wicked spikes along the backs of the hands and wrists. While wearing a cestus, you are considered armed and your unarmed attacks deal lethal damage. If you are proficient with a cestus, you can have your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning or piercing damage. Monks are proficient with the cestus. When using a cestus, your fingers are mostly exposed, allowing you to wield or carry items in that hand, but the constriction of the weapon at your knuckles gives you a –2 penalty on all precision-based tasks involving that hand (such as opening locks). A cestus can't be disarmed."""
5,Dagger,simple weapon,light,2,4,1,diminutive,19,2,10,1,P or S,"""A dagger is a fighting knife. Its blade is usually less than 1 foot long, and can be curved or straight, with one edge or two.

You get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand skill checks made to conceal a dagger on your body."""
6,Gauntlet,simple weapon,light,2,3,1,diminutive,20,2,-1,1,B,"""This metal glove lets you deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes. A strike with a gauntlet is otherwise considered an unarmed attack. The cost and weight given are for a single gauntlet. Medium and heavy armors (except breastplates) come with gauntlets. Your opponent cannot use a disarm action to disarm you of gauntlets."""
7,Light mace,simple weapon,light,5,6,1,diminutive,20,2,-1,4 ,B,"""A mace is made up of an ornate metal head attached to a simple wooden or metal shaft.

9,Sickle,simple weapon,light,6,6,1,diminutive,20,2,-1,2 ,S,"""Originating as a farming tool used for reaping grain, this one-handed weapon has a blade with a strong curve that can easily catch an opponent's limb or armor. Its blade can be either smooth or serrated, and some fighting sickles are sharpened on both sides near the point, making it easier to hook into an opponent's flesh."""
10,Spiked gauntlet,simple weapon,light,5,4,1,diminutive,20,2,-1,1,P,"""This is a gauntlet of thick leather or metal with blades or spikes protruding from above the knuckles, allowing the wearer to stab with the force of a punch. The cost and weight given are for a single gauntlet. An attack with a spiked gauntlet is considered an armed attack. Your opponent cannot disarm you of spiked gauntlets."""
11,Wooden stake,simple weapon,light,0,4,1,diminutive,20,2,10,1,P,"""This close combat weapon is just a sharpened piece of wood. Iron spikes that are used as weapons deal damage as wooden stakes."""

17,Bayonet,simple weapon,two,5,6,1,medium,20,2,-1,1,P,"""Bayonets are close combat weapons designed to fit into the grooves or muzzles of crossbows and firearms. They allow you to make melee attacks with these weapons but render them temporarily useless as ranged weapons. Attaching or removing a bayonet is a move action."""
18,Boar spear,simple weapon,two,5,8,1,medium,20,2,-1,8 ,P,"""This spear has a metal crossbar to protect you against onrushing attackers. If you ready a boar spear against a charge and your attack hits, you gain a +2 shield bonus to your AC against that creature until your next turn."""

22,Blowgun,simple weapon,two,2,2,1,medium,20,2,20,1,P,"""Blowguns are generally used to deliver debilitating (but rarely fatal) poisons from a distance. They are nearly silent when fired. For a list of appropriate poisons, see Poisons on page 110."""
23,Dart,simple weapon,two,5,4,1,medium,20,2,20,0.5,P,"""This thrown weapon is larger than an arrow and shorter than a javelin, with a weighted tip and a shorter range than a javelin. Most darts are wooden shafts with a thick metal point."""
24,Heavy crossbow,simple weapon,two,50,10,1,medium,19,2,120,8 ,P,"""You draw a heavy crossbow back by turning a small winch. Loading a heavy crossbow is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A heavy crossbow fires crossbow bolts.
Normally, operating a heavy crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a heavy crossbow with one hand at a –4 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a heavy crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two one-handed weapons. This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing."""
25,Javelin,simple weapon,two,1,6,1,medium,20,2,30,2 ,P,"""A javelin is a thin throwing spear . Since it is not designed for melee, you are treated as nonproficient with it and take a –4 penalty on attack rolls if you use a javelin as a melee weapon."""

Normally, operating a light crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a light crossbow with one hand at a –2 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot a light crossbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls as if attacking with two light weapons. This penalty is cumulative with the penalty for one-handed firing."""
27,Sling,simple weapon,two,0,4,1,medium,20,2,50,0,B,"""A sling is little more than a leather cup attached to a pair of strings. Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a sling, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand. Loading a sling is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity.
A sling fires sling bullets. You can hurl ordinary stones with a sling, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you and you take a –1 penalty on attack rolls."""
28,Underwater heavy crossbow,simple weapon,two,100,10,1,medium,19,2,120,8 ,P,"""Above water, this weapon is identical to a heavy crossbow. You may use it underwater, where it has a range increment of 20 feet. It counts as a heavy crossbow for the purposes of proficiencies and special abilities."""

30,Butterfly sword (2),martial weapon,light,20,4,1,diminutive,19,2,-1,1,S,"""These short matching swords come in pairs, cleverly nested together to appear as a single blade. Both weapons can be drawn at the same time, and they can be separated as a free action and wielded in both hands to make wickedly effective chops and slashes. Their thin, broad blades extend just 1 foot in length. A butterfly sword has a hardwood grip covered with braided cord, and a metal D-shaped guard to protect the wielder's hand. The listed price is for a pair of butterfly swords. Masterwork butterfly swords cost 320 gp for the pair. If you add magical enhancement bonuses or properties to a butterfly sword, treat each sword in the pair as a separate weapon (for example, adding a +1 magical enhancement bonus to a pair of masterwork butterfly swords costs 4,000 gp)."""
31,Dogslicer,martial weapon,light,8,6,1,diminutive,19,2,-1,1,S,"""This short, curved blade was created by goblins, who often drill numerous holes into it in an attempt to reduce its weight. Most dogslicers are sized for Small creatures."""
